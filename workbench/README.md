## When to use

- **Category:** Pairwise MA
- **Data shape:** pairwise effect sizes — one row per study with `{label, est, se}` (or CI).
- **Purpose:** Mini-forest + funnel + cumulative dashboard.

## Cite as

Click **📑 Cite as** inside the app for ready-to-paste Vancouver + BibTeX citations covering both the allmeta release and the relevant method paper(s).

## Reproducibility

- Receipts and JSON exports include `producedBy` (app version, git SHA, build timestamp) — see `shared/build-info.js`.
- For apps with a parity-checked engine, `shared/specs/` contains the R-reference test vectors. Run `python -m pytest tests/` for the full suite.
- Click **📝 Verify in R** to open a Shinylive R session with the current data pre-loaded for independent re-computation (where supported).
